the Alzheimer Analysis project, Pandas library was imported to create graphs and Gaussian Naive Bays, Decision Tree Classifier and Support Vector Machines were implemented based on the scikitlearn library. Furthermore, the language that is used in the project is python 2.7 and all of the python code was written in Jupyter Notebook.

The data set that I used in the Alzheimer Analysis project was obtained from Open Access Series of Imaging Studies(OASIS). http://www.oasis-brains.org/
