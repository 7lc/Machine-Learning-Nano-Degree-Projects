# Machine-Learning-Projects

This is a personal project repository that is specifically implemented for the Udacity's Machine Learning Nano Degree.

In the Alzheimer Analysis project, Pandas library is imported to create graphs and Gaussian Naive Bays, Decision Tree Classifier and Support Vector Machines are implemented based on the scikitlearn library. Furthermore, the language that is used in the project is  python 2.7 and all of the python code was written in Jupyter Notebook. 

The data set that I used in the capstone project was obtained from Open Access Series of Imaging Studies(OASIS).
